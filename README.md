Description:
A 3-state cellular automata simulator. Cells on the lattice can have values of
0, 1, or 2, and evolve according to their neighbors to the top, and top-left.
This simplification from the 2-state system, where top-right neighbors are
also considered, is done in order to reduce the number of rules (where rules
are mapping from neighborhoods to new states).
